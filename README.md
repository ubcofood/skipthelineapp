# Skipthelineapp 

## Updated features in Individual Project üìù


### Added "On the budget?" and "Protein" pages on Customer side of the website - Andela

-"On the budget?" page - **Spoonacular API**
 -To use Spoonacular API, we need to install it:
   ```
   pip install spoonacular
   ```
  - After that, we need to import it in the code and get our unique API KEY from https://spoonacular.com/food-api
   ```
  import spoonacular as sp
   ```
  - This page allows the customer to generate a random recipe on the click of "Get another recipe" button. The page will list the title of the recipe, number of servings, preparation time, ingridents and instructions for preparations alongside the image of the dish.

-"Protein" page - **USDA FoodData Central API**
 - To use this API we need a couple of supporting libraries to be imported at the start of the file:
   ```
   import requests
   import json
   ```
  - We also need to have our unique API key from https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html
  - This page highlights the importance of protein intake in one's diet and allows the customer to get information about protein content of any item they type into the search bar. Text typed into searchbar is then passed to USDA FoodData Central API, and a list of names of foods in that category is displayed alongside the protein content in grams. When typing into search bar again, customer can get data about protein content of another item.

## Description üìÑ

Skipthelineapp is an online food ordering system website serving UBC students across different vendors in the UNC building. The web application provides services for vendors, staff and customers (students) on campus. This application is a food ordering system with three interfaces i.e. vendor, admin and customer. Users can access the system with their unique credentials pre-registered on the website, and the login page has a selection menu that allows users to log in with the corresponding portal.

The web application allows customers to pay, order and collect food products without the need for them to physically wait in line. The food menus are presented in a card layout, allowing the customer to easily add items to their cart by tapping the add button. Each food product view includes product image, food description, price and allergen tags. The customer has either the option to pay with their UBC account via the flex dollar program or with their own credit/debit cards. Customers can order multiple items in a single order, and each order can be customizable which allows them to edit their dietary preferences. 

The program also has the vendor's portal allowing them to view current orders on display, including a detailed view of each customer's order associated with their order number. The vendors can view their daily transactions and revenue in the analytics tab, and export their sales data in pdf/table format. Vendors can also update their menus and product description, as well as manage employees and their roles.

The Admin portal provides access for new vendors to register and edit their profiles, it also has the functionality to remove a current vendor. The Admin Analytic tab provides a summary of all vendors and their performance, such as their daily transaction rate, monthly revenue rate and customer distribution. Each vendor has the option to disclose their sale data or otherwise, and only those data with the vendor's permission can only send to the admin's portal.

### Classes descriptions and functionalities:

Each user can interact with the system to perform an activity.

The login page has three navigation tabs allowing different types of users to log in accordingly.

The options available to the Admin are edit vendor list, update vendor logo, edit vendor's details, create vendor's account,add/remove vendors, export vendor data and view vendor analytics.

The options available to the Vendor are add food category, add food details, add food allergens, edit food descriptions, view order number, view order descriptions, update food order, edit menus, upload product picture, view revenue, view analytics and delete order.
